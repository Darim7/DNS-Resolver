# DNS-Resolver
This is a network project! :sunglasses:

## What did I do?
In this project, I use `dnspython` to make the queries processing responses.

### Basics
For the first part, I made a basic DNS resolver. It uses a recursive function `recurse()` to query for a domain name.

### DNSSec
Then I implemented the DNSSec using the `dnspython` package.
